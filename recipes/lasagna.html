        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chunk</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>2 gloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can of good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces of tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 can of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/ cup of chopped fresh parsley, packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch of garlic powder and7or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><h4>Put pasta water on to boil</h4> <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating. </p></li>
        <li><h4>Brown the ground beef</h4><p> In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.

            Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat. </p></li>
        <li><h4>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</h4><p> Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using yellow bell pepper and red onions).

            Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and cook half a minute more.
            
            Return the browned ground beef to the pan. Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><h4>Transfer to medium sized pot, add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</h4><p> Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot.

            Add the parsley, oregano, and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder and/or garlic salt, to taste.
            
            Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar. Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste. (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are that you are using.)
            
            Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.
            
            Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.
            
            Remove from heat</p></li>
        <li><h4>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Heat the oven to 190ÂºC</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Assemble the lasagna</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Bake</h4></li>
        <li><h4>Cool and serve</h4></li>
    </ol>
